# Java-2D-Rubiks-Cube
This is a self coded 3x3 (soon to be 22, 3x3, and 4x4) rubik cube with a functional main menu, scoreboard, and rubicks cube. there is a help button in the main game screen where the 3x3 cube is displayed.

The RubixJava2D.java contains the source code if you want to see how messy i am at coding and how i think :3
to execute the file, you first need to compile the file. if you can't you can contact me and i can send you the executable jar file
(I can't figure out how to upload external files yet).
