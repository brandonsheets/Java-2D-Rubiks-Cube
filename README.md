# Java-2D-Rubiks-Cube
This is a self coded 3x3 (soon to be 22, 3x3, and 4x4) rubik cube with a functional main menu, scoreboard, and rubicks cube. there is a help button in the main game screen where the 3x3 cube is displayed.

The RubixJava2D.java contains the source code if you want to see how messy i am at coding and how i think :3
to execute the file, you dont need to java a IDE to run it, download the run.bat file and execute it in the same folder as the RubixJava2D file. upon doing so, there will be another file called scoreboard.dat that will be created. You can delete it, but it will reset the scoreboard upon doing so.
