# Java-2D-Rubiks-Cube
This is a self coded 3x3 (soon to be 22, 3x3, and 4x4) rubik cube with a functional main menu, scoreboard, and rubicks cube. there is a help button in the main game screen where the 3x3 cube is displayed.

In this repo, there are two folders:
1) "Relesase" - this contains the most recent working build of the game in an executable jar file format
2) "Source" - this contains the source code if you want to see how messy i am at coding and how i think :3
